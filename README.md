### Getting started

#### Cloning the repo
1. Create your git repo  
    ```bash
    mkdir foldername  
    cd "/foldername"  
    git init  
    ```  

2. Clone this repo  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NathanNeelis/browser-technologies-2021.git
    ```   

3. install packages  
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```  

### Core funcionalities
The core functionalities of this app are:
* Overview page with all the photographs
* Detail page for each photograph with meta info
* Upload a photo to the overview page
* Add photo's to a series
* Overview page with photo's in a serie
* Edit meta information of a photograph

### Wireflows
#### Overview / home page
In the userflow the functional/reliable layer   
are the photographs on the page. No matter which circumstances, the user should always be able to see an overview of the photographs.   
  
The usable layer   
will be an enhancement with a grid-layout. This way the screen space is used effectively and layout changes depending on the device used.  
  
As a finishing touch we have the pleasurable layer   
which would be the checkboxes on the photographs to add them to your series without going to the detail page.  

#### Detail page
The functional/reliable layer  
is the photograph with its meta information. This is the most important information on this page. But almost equally as important is the option to add this photo to your series.  
  
The usable layer  
will be styling to make this page visually appealing and you should be able to edit the information on this page.  
  
The finishing touch in the pelasurable layer  
could be that you don't have to submit the option to add it to your series but only clicking on a add button would suffice.  

#### Upload page
The functional/reliable layer  
is uploading a photograph. The form should be working without javascript and with a bad internet connection.   
  
The usable layer  
will be styling the upload form. Also some form validation might come in handy here to give feedback to the user. 
  
The finishing touch in the pelasurable layer  
might be adding a geolocation option and storing unfinished forms in storage for example.
  
![userflow1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112154022-2be27d80-8be4-11eb-82c6-3fff241fcd83.jpg)  

#### Series page
The functional/reliable layer  
The user should always be able to see the images saved to their series page.  
  
The usable layer  
Adding styling to the page with a grid lay-out for example. This should make it repsonsive for other devices as well.  
  
The finishing touch in the pelasurable layer  
Changing views from slide-show to carousel and updating the order of the saved images by maybe a drag and drop system.  
  
![userflow2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112154090-38ff6c80-8be4-11eb-976a-09c4409b6235.jpg)

### The three layers
#### Functional / reliable layer
<details>
<summary>Functional / reliable layer</summary>

The reliable layer is the layer that always should work. No matter the circumstances. In this layer the core functionalities are the most important. In this readme under the heading `core functionalities` I listed those in this project. Below I will go through some pages, and show that without css and without javascript my functionalities still work.
  
#### Overview page  
The most important in this overview page is that you can use the navigation and see the content. The content are all the photographs shown on this page. It might not be beautifull and easy to read, but the content is all here!  
  
<img width="600" alt="basic overview page" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112501455-8e28b300-8d89-11eb-93ea-2139b9453c18.png">  
  
#### Detail page  
Just as important is the detail page. You can reach this page by clicking on a photograph in one of the overview pages. The most imporant on this page is that the content is shown. So you can see the image you clicked on in detail and read its meta information. 
Also a core functionality on this page is that you can select it to add it to your photo serie. This option is on the bottom of the basic page with a checkbox and a submit button.  
  
<img width="600" alt="basic detail page" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112501940-f37ca400-8d89-11eb-94cc-2c6d4598f9d3.png">  
  
#### Upload an image  
Another core functionality is uploading a photograph. Even without css and javascript this is possible by using the upload form. The form is hardly readable, but if you pay some attention to what goes where, it really isn't so hard to upload a photograph yourself in this basic state.  
  
<img width="600" alt="bacis upload form" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112502671-8d445100-8d8a-11eb-9043-eb5c366e1d56.png">  
  
#### Series overview page  
After you have selected some images in the detail page you can view all of your selected images in the series overview page. Just like the homepage is this page still readable after a fashion without css and javascript.   
  
#### Edit meta information
I am still in doubt if this really is a core functionality. But I though i'd treat it as one. Can't hurt to make this functionality always available even if you dont have CSS and Javascript. When you click on the edit link, you will be redirected to a edit page where you can edit the meta information in the form again and save it. The information will update right away! So in the gif below, I haven't styled these pages yet except for the navigation. And I have Javascript disabled.  
  
![update](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112503878-9550c080-8d8b-11eb-875d-ef767f1ce8df.gif)  
  

</details>

#### Usable layer
<details>
<summary>Usable layer</summary>

#### Accessibility  
So in the basics it should already be accessible. But we are going to add a visual layer to it to make the page better readable for users and give add extra hierarchy to elements that need to stand out. But in doing this, it is very important that we do not kill the accessibility. So this is the reason I also added this term to the usable layer, because we need to keep the photo album usable for everyone. This means when I add colors, I pay attention to contrast. In the WCAG guidelines the contrast should be 3:1 for big texts and 4.5:1 for smaller texts. I choose my collor scheme based on these guidelines.  
  
<img width="600" alt="contrast checker" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112494863-ab5a8300-8d83-11eb-9021-b9ff848133c6.png">  

I also made sure focus styles are in place and you can tab through the items in the photo album.  
  
<img width="600" alt="Focus styles" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112495094-de9d1200-8d83-11eb-97a8-0d961e5c539e.png">  


#### Hierarchy
My upload form was in my opinion most in need of hierarchy. Using css styling I added the hierarchy so now you can see which labels belong to which input fields and where you need to drop your file to upload it.  
  
<img width="600" alt="upload form" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112495369-22901700-8d84-11eb-973b-80673ac1cc48.png">  
  
#### Ordening
In the functional layer, all information is shown from top to bottom. To make the overview page more readable there needed to be some order in displaying the images with their titles.  
  
<img width="600" alt="unordered page" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112496176-cf6a9400-8d84-11eb-82d4-9bd1a43147db.png">  
  
To do this, I started with display grid, and made a row lay-out that gives the overview page a very clean and orderly feeling.
I wanted to use grid masonry, but it isnt supported at al, only in Moz Firefox and then only if you enable it. This is still the plan to do with @supports. But in this example I used the 'old' grid styling to accomplish this lay-out.  
  
<img width="600" alt="grid layout" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112496772-4c960900-8d85-11eb-9ce4-1228b187f03d.png">  
  
#### Responsive
Another way to improve the usability is making sure the photo album is responsive. By adding flex-boxes and grid lay-outs the album already becomes very responsive. But since I used a row lay-out for my overview pages I had to write some media queries to scale the amount of rows. Ofcours this is done from a mobile-first point of view.  
  
<img width="250" alt="Overview page on mobile device" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112499352-ac8daf00-8d87-11eb-9470-30447db89c1b.png">  
  
#### Geolocation
Adding an geolocation option is very close to the pleasurable layer, but in this use case I actually think its still in the usable layer. Using geolocation you can add your location in the meta info without even thinking about where you are at the moment. As the most beautifull images are mostly made abroad and sometimes deep in nature, this option is very usable. I will explain more about how this feature works in the browser testing tab, but in the gif below you can see that just by hitting the icon your location gets added in the input field.  
  
![Geolocation_MBP_Brave](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112505114-c1207600-8d8c-11eb-8340-561250e8df22.gif)  
  
</details>

#### Pleasurable layer
<details>
<summary>Pleasurable layer</summary>

#### Drag and drop
Looking through your photographs, you finally find the one that you would like to upload. Hitting the browse button lets you search your file all over again. This can be a very frustrating experience. Using this drag and drop feature, you can just grab your file and drop it into the dropzone. And if you're not at home and on a mobile device, you can just click on the dropzone and even choose between taking a new photograph or selecting one in your files. The orignal method works just as well, because, you can actually drag and drop onto a original input field with the file type. But not many people know it, and you can't really style the element and tell the user you can. That is why this is in the pleasurable layer.  
  
![DragDrop_Android_Moz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112506013-a1d61880-8d8d-11eb-91d8-9ff919312994.gif)  
  
#### User feedback
By user feedback, I dont mean that all user feedback should be in the pleasurable layer. But since the feedback I give the user are already an enhancement I put this feedback in this layer. The first type of feedback I am giving the user is when you drag and drop an image in the dropzone of the upload form. The feedback the user gets is an thumbnail of the image he is uploading and the name of the file for reference.  
  
![DragDrop_MBP_Brave](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112506396-fe393800-8d8d-11eb-8478-c984ad799fc8.gif)  
  
The second type of feedback I am giving is on the geolocation option. When you click the button, it might take a few seconds to get your actual location into the browser and convert it by reverse geocoding. When this happends it shows you a spinner that something is happening. When I first tried if it worked, it already annoyed me that I wasnt seeing if it was working of not! Now I know that my request is being processed. Another type of feedback is when it takes to long to request the location. It might be very possible that you are in a location that isn't found or that your device/browser isn't allowing to use the location. Then you will see a message that your location cannot be found and that you will have to type it in manually. In the gif below I passed in a unknown location, you can see the spinner working and then you will see the error in the console. The message is displayed in the placeholder for now. 
  
![Geolocation_Error_MBP_Chrome](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112507022-9800e500-8d8e-11eb-9a22-8d93ef74231b.gif)  


#### Grid masonry
As a cherry on top I wanted to code the overview pages in a grid masonry. As this is not supported anywhere this really is a pleasurable layer. This is still on my to-do-list at this moment, time is running short. But I wanted to let you know that I atleast though about it.

### Testing report
#### Geolocation
<details>
  <summary>Test report Geolocation</summary>

I enhanched my location input with a button that saves your location in your input. I did this by using the geolocation api to fetch the longitude and latitude values of your current location. These values get passed into another fetch for reverse geocoding which transforms the data into a location by for example a city.
Below here is a data object that is fetched from my own current location. The value that should get passed in the location input is the city.

As I live on the edge of Alkmaar this worked wonderfully in the browser, but when I started testing on my mobile, it wouldnt work. In the image below I am testing it on a Android phone via browserstack. I also tested on a real Android phone, which worked better but I couldnt save it in a gif. What you see happening here is that I am trying to locate myself, but it gets stuck on 'loading data'. This is because when you click the button, it changes to placeholder to loading data, and when it finds your location updates the value of the input with our location. But that wasnt happening.  
  
![Geolocation_LoadingData_Android_Moz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112483909-c1634600-8d79-11eb-8bf6-61507d03978f.gif)  
  
I also wasnt to happy with the placeholder being changed in loading data. I wanted to update the usable layer here, so the user would get better feedback. I removed the placeholder and added a spinner. But the location issue is still here. Once you hit the button, it keeps spinning instead of updating the input value. Funny thing is, it did update in my browser on my macbook.  
  
![Geolocation_Spinner_Android_Moz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112484327-2159ec80-8d7a-11eb-8fe6-a934a0da5cf9.gif)  
  
I guess, this is one of those big reasons you test on multiple devices and on multiple browsers. I found out what the issue was, and fixed it. It turned out I was looking for the city, but if you werent in a city, it gave a response of an empty string. So I wrote some extra if statements that if there isnt a city available, fetch other data like locality, prinicipal subdivision or even country. If all of those are not found, then give the user feedback the location can't be found. Below here I have added a use case of a faulty location. You see the placeholder being updated with a message that the location cannot be found. I know this isnt the most beautifull way of giving the user feedback, but that's a thing for later to be updated.  
  
![Geolocation_Error_MBP_Chrome](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112484884-a218e880-8d7a-11eb-8e50-7c214415972c.gif)  
  
So after this update the geolocation worked wonderful in most testcases; MacbookPro - Chrome, Macbookpro - Brave, Android - Mozzila Firefox. But it doesnt work in IOS Safari. Below here opened a Iphone 8 in a browserstack with the console log open to see whats happening. It turns out the geolocation is just denied. The same is happening on my MacbookPro in safari. It might be a setting somewhere, but I couldnt find it.  
  
![Geolocation_IOS_Safari](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112485440-3be09580-8d7b-11eb-9bc1-abbbb6dafc73.gif)  

Because not everyone has geolocation enabled, and I didnt want it to break the rest of my Javascript checked if the geolocation is available in the browser.
```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) { // checks if geolocation is available in the browser
    const getLocation = document.getElementById('getLocation')
    if (getLocation) { // checks if element is on current page
        getLocation.addEventListener('click', clickForLocation)
    }
}
```

Some of my tries to fetch my data where extremely slow, to get more insight in this I console timed the events of fetching the geolocation and the reverse geocoding. In the gif below you see that I am testing this feature on my MacbookPro in the Chrome browser. In the console you can see how long it took to get this data.  
  
![Geolocation_MBP_Chrome](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112486099-dfca4100-8d7b-11eb-8337-45f219aef033.gif)  
  
The Brave browser was alot quicker, but it might have still cached my location somewhere though.  
  
![Geolocation_MBP_Brave](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112486235-fc667900-8d7b-11eb-8142-b0911028cb3f.gif)

#### Drag & Drop
<details>
<summary>Test report Drag & Drop</summary>
  
So in my form I wanted to have a drag and drop when you upload your photograph to the story. But I found out, that for drag and drop you actually don't have to do anything! Drag and drop usually works on input type=fyle elements. But I wanted to take it to the next level. The drag and drop box was kind of small so I styled the whole thing for usability. Now there is a big enough space to drop your photo in. And as you see later in the gif examples, whenever you drag a file into the box the dashed line becomes solid. This is the feedback to the user I was looking for in my usable layer. But to really lift this drag and drop box to the next level I added a pleasureable layer. When you drop a photo in it, you get a thumbnial view from the image you are uploading with the file name. How cool is that! Below here an example of my testing on my MacbookPro in Chrome.  
  
![DragDrop_MBP_Chrome](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112491021-320d6100-8d80-11eb-83c6-3fbe2ab777c6.gif)  
  
So that worked smoothly! Does it work as well in Brave? Well I though it did!  
  
![DragDrop_MBP_Brave](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112491288-7567cf80-8d80-11eb-8c5d-d6a4918eacf3.gif)  
  
I found a video that explained this very well every step of the way. But the author put his input on display none, and worked with the label. So when I tried tabbing through my form, it skipped the drag and drop field.. That's a pretty poor experience. So I styled it properly, and now it is accessible as well!  
  
![DragDrop_FocusStyles](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112491625-c8418700-8d80-11eb-8492-7bc7bd3cd11a.gif)  
  
This drag and drop system is great! But when you are on a mobile device, you dont really have anything to drag into the dropzone. So to serve these users as well you can also just click on the dropzone to upload your photograph. And when I tested this on a mobile device, you don't actually have to search for your file, but you can just take your photograph as well! How handy is that when you're somewhere high up in the mountains! I tested this on IOS and Andriod, but it worked on both devices just as well.
  
![DragDrop_IOS_Safari](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55492381/112491962-1f475c00-8d81-11eb-9180-c1062b4d77cf.gif)  
  
Well this whole drag and drop is alot of client-side javascript. What if for some reason it is disabled? Well I also tested this, below in the gif you can see the example in chrome. If javascript is turned off, you will just get the original input field. When you load your javascript it adds classes to the dropzone fields. So it becomes active. If javascript isn't loaded, it won't add those classes so you dont get a label field that is no use at all.
  
```javascript
// If javascript is enabled set input field op display none;
const dragDropCheck = document.querySelector('.drop-zone')

if (dragDropCheck) {
    uploadImageFailsave()
